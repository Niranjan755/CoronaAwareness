                <p>We are currently experiencing the effects of the first wave,
                     where deaths and disability are directly linked to COVID-19.
                      Alongside the atrocious death toll, an as yet untold number of
                       people are living with the lasting aftermath of a severe acute 
                       respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection—for some, 
                       even mild COVID-19 can be debilitating for months on end,
                        even after they are clinically cured of the infection.

           <h3 style=" margin-right:10px ;padding: 10px;">SECOND WAVE</h3>
           <p>The second wave refers to those who will suffer in the medium-term due
                to measures taken to limit the spread of COVID-19. It includes,
                 among many others, those who delay presenting to healthcare facilities
                  for fear of COVID-19 infection; those with progressive diseases whose 
                  appointments are rescheduled; and those who miss routine screening. 
                  The question of how doctors, particularly those working in primary care, 
                  will navigate the backlog remains unanswered.

           <p>The third wave is the effect of virus on the social determinants of health,
                and its effects on the next generation.2 The virus will worsen health
                 inequalities through severe economic injury.3 It is the sectors that 
                 rely on low-paid staff (often women, young people and Black, Asian and 
                 minority ethnic (BAME) people) that will take longest to recover from the
                 predicted deep economic recession.3 The health impacts caused by this

        • Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in
         close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre (short-range).
          A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus
           are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth.
           People may also become infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated by the virus when touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.

Further research is ongoing to better understand the spread of the virus and which settings are most risky and why.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food.
         The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed at temperatures similar
          to that of other known viruses and bacteria found in food.

    <strong>Avoid Contact With Sick People</strong>
    <p>A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the coronavirus.</p>
